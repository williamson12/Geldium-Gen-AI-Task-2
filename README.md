# Tata Data Analytics Virtual Internship 2025 – Task 2

This repository contains my submission for Task 2 of the Tata Data Analytics Virtual Internship 2025. The focus of this task is on predictive modeling with the Geldium dataset, building upon the data quality insights and exploratory analysis from Task 1. Leveraging GenAI-powered techniques, the objective is to design a responsible, explainable, and robust credit risk prediction model that demonstrates both technical rigor and ethical considerations in AI-driven decision-making.

## 📌 Task Objective

The goal of this task is to develop a structured predictive modeling plan to identify customers at risk of delinquency, leveraging AI/ML techniques and supported by GenAI-driven tools for enhanced analysis and explainability.

Key objectives include:

- ✅ Designing the model framework for binary classification (delinquent vs. non-delinquent)
- ✅ Selecting and justifying the use of Logistic Regression as the baseline model
- ✅ Outlining a plan for model evaluation using industry-standard performance metrics
- ✅ Incorporating ethical considerations such as bias mitigation, fairness, and explainability
