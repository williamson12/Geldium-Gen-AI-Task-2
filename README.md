# Tata Data Analytics Virtual Internship 2025 – Task 2

This repository contains my submission for Task 2 of the Tata Data Analytics Virtual Internship 2025. The focus of this task is on predictive modeling with the Geldium dataset, building upon the data quality insights and exploratory analysis from Task 1. Leveraging GenAI-powered techniques, the objective is to design a responsible, explainable, and robust credit risk prediction model that demonstrates both technical rigor and ethical considerations in AI-driven decision-making.

## 📌 Task Objective

The goal of this task is to develop a structured predictive modeling plan to identify customers at risk of delinquency, leveraging AI/ML techniques and supported by GenAI-driven tools for enhanced analysis and explainability.

Key objectives include:

- ✅ Designing the model framework for binary classification (delinquent vs. non-delinquent)
- ✅ Selecting and justifying the use of Logistic Regression as the baseline model
- ✅ Outlining a plan for model evaluation using industry-standard performance metrics
- ✅ Incorporating ethical considerations such as bias mitigation, fairness, and explainability

## 🛠️ Tools & Platform Used

- **GenAI tools** like ChatGPT & Gemini (for logic generation and refinement)
- **Prompt-driven modeling approach**
- **Microsoft Word** – final plan drafted and formatted for submission
- Dataset provided via **GNI platform**

## 🧠 GenAI Prompt Used

"You are an expert data scientist specializing in credit risk modeling. Suggest a structured predictive modeling approach to identify credit delinquency using features such as income, credit score, repayment history, and missed payments. Clearly justify the choice of algorithm(s) (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Ensemble Models) based on interpretability and performance. Provide a step-by-step plan covering data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and validation. Finally, recommend appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., AUC, Precision-Recall, F1-score) to assess the model, and highlight how to ensure fairness, transparency, and explainability in the predictions."
